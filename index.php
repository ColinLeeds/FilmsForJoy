	  <h1>Films For Joy</h1>
	  I like films, me.<br><br>
Even better, I like discovering new films. 
Classic films, modern films, obscure art-house or big blockbuster - if you think I should check it out, I'd love to hear from you.<br><br>
The lovely Colin built me this site so I can keep track of what I've been watching (and because the vortex in my handbag destroys hand-scribbled notes). 
To stop it becoming a list of bad porn flicks you'll need a login to add a film, but just drop me a line through the usual channels & I'll send you one. 
Of course, if there are any bad porn flicks you think should be on the list, then we can always add a category for that...<br><br>
Right &#45; lights, camera, action &#45; recommend away!<br><br><br>
